**Welcome to a Website for Geography Teaching Tools**

The suite of workshops below use online resources and open source software (or common software such as Microsoft Excel) to investigate coastal erosion and inundation hazards. These hazards will be examined over two time points - present  and 2100 - and over two time scales - short-term event driven and chronic coastal change. 

The goal of these workshops is to get students to:

* access trusted online data sources
* investigate and understand coastal change using real world data
* wrangle real world data and analyse coastal change
* investigate and represent data in figures and charts
* perform basic statistical analysis to interpret change
* model coastal response to sea level rise and storm events
* develop foundational geography conceptual understanding in temporal scales of change in a natural system
* communicate hazards and risk using mapping software
* analyse risk to communities using hazard maps
